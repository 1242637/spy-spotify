# ME-Sp0tify-recorder-CSharp
This app ecords the Spotify tracks directly from the soundcard and adds the track and artist information in the mp3 title. There are many options to play with. It can also record Spotify Web Player on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer. It works better on Chrome and if you have an ad block installed (like uBlock Origin) it won't play any ads during the session. No Spotify Premium account is required. It uses NAudio and LAME DLLs.
