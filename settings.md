## About the recording order number
Adding the recording order number to files `017_Artiste_-_Titre.mp3` is useful if you want to burn songs to cds and that your mp3 player (like those in cars) orders songs by files name. You will get the a cd with songs ordered in the same order than the album. If it's a playlist, order it first on Spotify and start Spytify.
